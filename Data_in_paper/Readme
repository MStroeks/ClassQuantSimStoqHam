Data Folders:

Figure-3-folder: Contains the data of the signals presented in Figure 3.

Figure-4-folder: Contains the data of the signals of which the spectral estimates are presented in Figure 4. The StoqMCsimulations file contains functions
exctract the spectral estimates from the signals. The 'ftaudata' and 'gfulldata' files contain resp. the noisy and noiseless versions of the imaginary-time
signals, the 'qpenoisydata' and 'qpedata' contain resp. the noisy and noiseless versions of the real-time signals. The number in the filename is associated
with a value of 'g' in the spectrum. The '...datag4sigmaK' files contain the signals from which the spectral estimates displayed in the lower four plots
in Figure 4 are obtained.

Figure-A1-folder: Contains the data presented in Figure A1.
